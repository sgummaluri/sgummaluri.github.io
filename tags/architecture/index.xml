      <description>Every software developer that ever worked on a project that has been under development for a considerable amount of time or ever dealt with a mature codebase, would have criticised the way things are structured in the project or might have even cussed about the orchestration of the components and the design overall.
This inevitably seems to happen in scenarios where a new developer is on-boarded to work on a project/product that is already in production and has real users using that product.</description>
